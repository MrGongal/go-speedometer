### Description

"Speedometer" is a script for the FiveM server that allows you to measure and display the current speed of vehicles in real time. 
It provides a user interface to show speed in a readable format and can be easily integrated with other server resources.

### Installation

1. Download the "Speedometer" files from this repository.

2. Place the files in your FiveM server resources folder (usually located in resources).

3. Add start speedometer to your server.cfg file to start the feature automatically when the server starts.

#### How to use

When a player is inside a vehicle on the server, 
the "Speedometer" will be activated automatically. 
The vehicle's current speed will be shown in the bottom right corner of the player's screen.
